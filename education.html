			<td>2007-2008</td>
			<td>Tadika Maria is a kindergarten that is located in Kajang, Selangor. When I was a student there, the kindergarten used to be next to a commuter rail so we often hear the sounds of commuters passing by. Now, it is located somewhere else because the previous spot is now part of the MRT station. The kindergarten is also attended by my brother and my second oldest sister when they were younger as well.</td>

Most SEJATI students would attend JATISS during their teenage years. Unlike kindergarten and primary school, all of my siblings, and myself included, attended JATISS as our secondary school. I had many fond memories during my time as a student there.</td>

			<td>2020-now</td>
			<td>I am currently pursuing studies in Diploma in Information Management and now, I am in my final semester. I enjoy being here because Kelantan is known as a foodie's paradise. I can get a variety of foods at a low cost. I have never went to Kelantan before so when I received my acceptance letter, I was surprised that I got a campus that is so far away from home. At first, I was very homesick but I eventually adapted slowly. Deep inside, I feel like it is a blessing that I was placed in Machang and got to experience new things in a new environment.</td>
