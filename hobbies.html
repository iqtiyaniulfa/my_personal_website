	<h1 style="font-family: Georgia; text-align: center; color: beige;">What I love to do during my spare time!</h1>

	<h2 style="text-align: center; color: saddlebrown;">Reading as an escape</h2>

	<center><img style="width: 500px; height: 500px;" src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/0f/ff/75/0fff75b75c87e213681b02589b4d27c7.jpg"></center>

	<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">One of the things that I love to do the most during my spare time is reading. I love reading novels, especially English novels. Some of my favourite genres include romance, fantasy, thriller and dark fantasy. Furthermore, I also read fanfictions, which are online novels or stories written by fans of a specific show, movie, book, video game and so on.</p>

	<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Because of my love of reading, I often find myself creating fake scenarios in my head when I am bored and having a huge imagination as a result.</p>

	<h2 style="text-align: center; color: saddlebrown;">Drawing to relieve stress</h2>

	<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Some of the other things that I love to do the most during my spare time is drawing. When I was in primary school and secondary school, I often draw or doodle things when I was getting sleepy and no longer able to focus on the lesson in class. This became a habit that I am unable to let go so easily. While I am no professional artist by any means, my drawings are decent and pretty enough that I even dreamed that I aspire to become a comic artist one day.</p>

	<h2 style="text-align: center; color: saddlebrown;">Vibing while listening to music</h2>

	<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">And last but not least, I also love listening to music. Music plays a great role in people's life. It keeps us busy during our spare time and make our lives more interesting. Some of my most favourite music genres are Pop, K-pop and Hip-Hop music, but I am also do not mind to explore other genres as well. Moreover, music also helps to relax my mind or ease my boredom especially during long journeys on the road for example.</p>

	<p style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">When I put on my earphones and headphones, I feel like I am diving into another world!</p>
